# Star Wars API - React AJAX practice

---

## Intro

In this deliverable, you'll consume the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) and render it's data.

## Set Up

To get set up:

- Use `create-react-app` to create a React app named `react-star-wars`
- `cd` into `react-star-wars` and open VS Code.
- Open a terminal in VS Code.
- Start the React Dev Server.

## Exercises

> Styling is secondary to completing the functionality

1. Obtain all of the starships from the API and render in `<App>` a clickable `<Link>` (imported from `react-router-dom`) for each starship. The link should be styled to look like a button and contain the text of the starship's name.  For example:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VERV0nk.png">

2. When a starship `<Link>` is clicked a `<StarshipPage>` component should be rendered that displays the starship's `name`, `model` and a "Return to Starship List" `<Link>` that routes back to the root route that renders `<App>`. For example:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IjRwsHk.png">

5. Because the data is being loaded asynchronously, there are times, such as if the user refreshes the page while viewing the `<StarshipPage>`, that the data won't be available to render, in this case, display a "Loading..." message instead.

## Hints

- Hold the starships in state.

- The challenge is to be able to have the `<StarshipPage>` component obtain the specific starship object it needs to render. Here are a few of approaches:

	1. A nice approach is to use a slightly more complex syntax that React Router's `<Link>` offers.  This approach relies on assigning an object instead of a string to its `to` prop.  That object passed can have a `state` property that allows information to be passed to the new route. For example:
	
```js
this.state.starships.map(starship =>
  <Link
    to={{
      pathname: '/starship',
      state: starship
    }}
    key={starship.name}
  >
    {{starship.name}}
  </Link>
```

And ***inside your switch statement*** you'll write your `Route` like so:
```js
            <Route path='/starship' render={({location}) => 
              <StarshipPage location={location}/>
            }/>
```

You'll then be able to access the passed state on the route's `location` object...
		
```js
	this.props.location.state.starship
```

Be sure the `<Route>` component that is rendering `<StarshipPage>` passes the `location` object to it.

2. Another approach would be to pass to `<StarshipPage>` a method as a prop that it can call, supplying an argument identifying which starship object it wants. That argument's value could come from a URL parameter in the link that was clicked...

Review the Client-side Routing in React lesson's _Defining Routes with URL Parameters_ section for assistance with how to define routes with parameters used to pass information to components.


## Bonus

- Enhance the `<StarshipPage>` component to render a `<PilotList>` component that lists the names of the pilots for that starship.

- If the starship has no pilots, display a "No Pilots" message.

	Hint: This requires a call to the API for each of the endpoints listed in the starship's `pilots` array. Using `async`/`await` can help with this - [here's a repl](https://repl.it/@jim_clark/Multiple-AJAX-Calls) that shows how to fetch the pilots in parallel.
